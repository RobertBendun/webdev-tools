# webdev-tools

This repository is a collection of tools that I use for building my personal website [bendun.cc](https://bendun.cc). They are implementation specific, but feel free to generalize or use them in your own project.

## Philosophy

Modern web is bloated. You don't need 1mln lines of custom JavaScript framework to build your website. HTML is mostly fine, but to optimize writing time Markdown is better. CSS should be minimal, providing common aesthetic for website. Minification is against curious programmers, and in favour of large and unnesesary frameworks. Leave it as simple as possible and automate what is boring.

## Dependencies
